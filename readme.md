# Blubb App

## What is Blubb ?

Blubb is an app for Diving-Logs.
The mission is to eliminate the - state of art - paperwork and to digitize it with a handy app.

## Notes

Currently the app is in a very early alpha stage. Means it is buggy and many features are not working at all.

Later on, the app will have a front-end (folder client) and a back-end (folder server).

## How to review ?

**Currently the server is not in use! However, it won't throw an error if started.**

If no Heroku link is available and you want to run it locally:

- Client and Server (Port 3000): <br>

```
npm run dev
```

- only Client (Port 3000): <br>
  --> change to client folder

```
npm run dev
```

- only Server (Port 4000): <br>
  --> change to server folder

```
node server
```
